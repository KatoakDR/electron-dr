array for active scripts:
runningScriptArr = []

if command starts with .
clear require cache
load script means a function returns an object:
{
  parseXML: fn
  parseText: fn
  parseEvent: fn
  initializeScript: fn
} // ok, but is there a way we can abort a script even if the parseEvent function isn't working?

runningScriptArr.push()

ok, the throwing error thing seemed genius but it doesn't unload any timeouts or intervals from memory it just returns, and if you process.exit it kills the entire electron process
so scripts have to be loaded in a worker thread or child process (I think worker thread), there is no choice
but we can offload most of the logic of passing script events to the loadscript.js file
I think we keep the hot reload logic but trigger it on something besides '.scriptname'
